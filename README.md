# AWS Static Website Hosting Project

In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS using multiple core services:

- **Amazon S3** → for static website hosting 
- **IAM** → for secure access management with least privilege  
- **VPC + EC2** → for hosting a backend server inside a custom network  
- **CloudFront** → for global content delivery and HTTPS support
